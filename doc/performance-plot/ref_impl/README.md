Fractal Compression
======================

"Fractal image compression is a promising new technology..." (J. K)

Based on my research during the term in 2004 I have explored the area of Fractal Image Compression. This area is heavily tied in with Iterated Function Systems that we have studied as part of the course. The papers that I have read (including the one I reviewed) range from touching the basics of this technology to combining multiple technologies together.

I have decided to make an application in C++, which encodes and decodes one or three channel image using the most optimal algorithms that are fractal-specific. As part of my future research I would really be interested in combining fractal technology with other (such as JPEG) to compliment each other in achieving optimal compression to quality ratio.
