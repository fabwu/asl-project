\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Human perception is relying heavily on visual information, especially images. 
This medium is very powerful to gain and transfer \textit{ideas}, memories and emotions. 
No one would doub the saying  "A picture says more than a thousand words".\\
In these times of digitalization and the further advancement of the internet, the need
to share and store images thus is crucial. This imposes practical challenges, for example
how more images are stored with less space and how one can transfer images faster from A to B.\\
A very practical way to do this is to decrease the image quality in places where a better-quality
image is not perceivable or where lower-quality images are not disruptive. \\
JPEG, whose basic building block is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), is undoubtedly the most widely used lossy compression scheme. 
With good compression quality and fast compression times, JPEG hits a sweet spot for many practical applications.\\
Fractal image compression is another family of lossy compression schemes. The main idea is to compress an image by exposing self-similarity, 
which can be observed in many places in nature (e.g. fir cones or the romanesco broccoli).\\
Contrary to JPEG, the underlying theoretical construct of a fractal compression scheme is that of an iterated function system (IFS).\\
This approach yields great compression results in terms of compression size and quality \cite{fisher2012}. 
However, it is computationally expensive to encode
images because the algorithm involves an exhaustive search over different regions of the image (section \ref{sec:background}) 
with lots of numerical computations to find self-similarity. Optimizing these computations is thus crucial for an efficient implementation of the algorithm.

\mypar{Related work}
The most widely known practical fractal compression scheme was developed and patented by Michael Barnsley and Alan Sloan in 1987.
They published a paper about their work in 1989 \cite{barnsley1989fractal}.
Barnsleys graduate student Arnaud Jacquin was the first who implemented a practical version of it in 1992 \cite{jacquin1990fractal} in his PhD thesis.
Numerous improvements and variations have then been developed to this original approach, 
e.g. archetype classification (\cite{jacobs1992image}, \cite{boss1991studies}) which decreases the exhaustive search space for self-similarity. 
Yuval Fisher published a book in 2012 with a detailed description of various fractal schemes and an elaborate list of optimizations \cite{fisher2012}.

\mypar{Contribution}
Basing ourselves on the explanations of Fisher in \cite{fisher2012} and an open-source implementation in Python \cite{github-python} and C++ \cite{github-cpp}, 
we implemented our own fractal image compression scheme with quadtree partitioning and exhaustive self-similarity search. \\ 
In our work, we did not focus on algorithmic optimizations, but optimized the given computations as best as we could.
