\section{Contributions of Team Members}

\mypar{Jonas} Focused on the baseline implementation and the following scalar optimizations 
(ILP, removal of structs, removal of pointer chasing and decreasing of memory reallocation). 
Helped in prototyping SIMD (especially the four-domain-blocks-a-time approach) 
and contributed to the solution which increased SIMD performance regarding 90 and 270 degree rotations. \\
Wrote a tool to simulate cache access in order to determine tighter memory bounds in the roofline plot. \\
Experimented with block-wise domain/range block traversal.

\mypar{Pascal} \dots

\mypar{Fabian} Added rotations to baseline. Created roofline plot and compared baseline to reference 
implementation. ILP and index optimizations for $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i$ calculation. 

Implemented parts of four-domain-blocks-a-time SIMD (tricky part was error calculcation with 
\verb|blendv| and mask) and participated in bringing the two SIMD approaches together. 
Helped increasing performance regarding 90 and 270 degree rotations.

\mypar{Janis} Changed baseline from C\texttt{++} to C and started with the implementation of a fast queue.
Due to personal problems he withdrew from the project.
