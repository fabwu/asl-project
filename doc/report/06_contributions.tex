\section{Contributions of Team Members}

\mypar{Jonas} Focused on the baseline implementation and the following scalar optimizations 
(ILP, removal of structs, removal of pointer chasing and decreasing of memory reallocation). 
Helped in prototyping SIMD (especially the four-domain-blocks-a-time approach) 
and contributed to the solution which increased SIMD performance regarding 90 and 270 degree rotations. \\
Wrote a tool to simulate cache access in order to determine tighter memory bounds in the roofline plot. \\
Experimented with block-wise domain/range block traversal.
