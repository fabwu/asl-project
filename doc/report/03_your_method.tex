\section{Proposed method}\label{sec:yourmethod}

This section defines the scope of our implementation, describes our initial baseline
implementation, analyzes its bottlenecks and outlines the steps which were followed to
increase performance.

\mypar{Scope}
In our project, we focus on grayscale of size $S \times S$, where $S$ is a power of two.
We use quadtree partitioning with maximum depth $7$, error threshold $\epsilon = 300$ and ensure
that the range blocks do not get smaller than $4 \times 4$ pixels which simplifies vectorization.
Furthermore, exhaustive block mapping to search for suitable transformations is used.
Our focus is solely on compression, which is the main challenge in fractal image compression.


\mypar{Basic implementation}
The baseline is written from scratch in C.

Algorithm \ref{alg:baseline} illustrates the compression of the algorithm, whose inputs are the image (row-wise array of doubles) of size $S \times S$,
the max quadtree depth $m$ and the error threshold $\epsilon$.\\
The function \textsc{partition($image$,$s$)} partitions the image into contiguous non-overlapping blocks of size $s \times s$.
The function \textsc{quad($R_i$, $s$)} takes a range block of size $s \times s$ and partitions it into 4 smaller range blocks.
The function \textsc{compute($image$,$R_i$, $D_i$)} computes a transformation with its resulting RMS according to section \ref{sec:background}. 
This function also downscales the domain block to the size of the range block, rotates it three times (90, 180 and 270 degrees) 
and returns the best of the four possible transformations.

                \State $err_i \gets err_x$

          \State $\boldsymbol{R} \gets \boldsymbol{R} \cup  \Call{quad}{R_i, S/2^c}$
        \Else
          \State $\boldsymbol{T} \gets \boldsymbol{T} \cup \{T_i\}$
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

As opposed to algorithms in \cite{fisher2012}i and \cite{github-cpp}, this algorithm does not implement quadtreee
partitioning recursively but iteratively.
Our optimized versions (see later) depend heavily on precomputations of domain blocks (especially downscaling).
At every quadtree depth, the domain blocks shrink with the range blocks. More specific, at every quadtree depth $c$ we have a pool of
domain blocks $D^{(c)}$. In an iterative approach, we can perform precomputations on $D^{(c)}$, process all domain/range block pairs 
and then discard the precomputations. Using a recursive approach, all precomputations of all domain block pools must be kept in memory
to avoid recomputing the precomputations.

More mathematically, assume that a domain block precomputation requires $\alpha$ bytes of memory.
Then, for a maximum quadtree depth $M$, our iterative approach requires at most 
$alpha \cdot |D^{(M)}| = \alpha \cdot 2^{2M-2}$ bytes for precomputations 
whereas the recursive approach needs at most $\sum_{i=1}^M \alpha \cdot |D^{(i)}|$ bytes.

In order to see if our baseline achieves a reasonable performance, we compared it with
a popular C\texttt{++} implementation from GitHub \cite{github-cpp}. We used the same infrastructure to benchmark
the C\texttt{++} code and our baseline performed slightly better (see !!!ADD LINE TO PERFORMANCEPLOT!!!).

\mypar{Scope} For our implementation only square grayscale images with a power
of two width and height were considered. The reason for the restriction on the
size is that it simplifies \textit{Quadtree Partitioning}. If the width of a
range block is a power of two and no suitable transformation is found for it,
then the four new range blocks created by dividing the original range block into
4 equal parts will also have a power of two width. Colored images can be
compressed and decompressed in the same manner as grayscale images.

\notepascal{are we sure about the color stuff?}

\mypar{Roofline} We used the roofline model \cite{applying-roofline} to see whether the algorithm is memory or
compute bound. The peak performance $\pi$ was determined by counting the dispatch
ports specified in the manual \cite{intel-opt-manual}. We distinguish between scalar and vectorized peak
performance. The bandwidth $\beta$ was measured with the STREAM benchmark \cite{stream}. We verified both the peak
performance and the bandwidth with the Empirical Roofline Tool \cite{ert}, which confirmed the values.

For the program model, we need to measure the work $W$, the runtime $T$ and the data move movement $Q$ of
the algorithm. Due to the dynamic nature of quadtree, the model does not only depend on the image size 
but also on the content of the image itself. Therefore, we define the three 
quantities as $W=W(S, img)$, $T=T(S, img)$ and $Q=Q(S, img)$, where $S$ and $img$ are define as in 
\ref{alg:baseline}. We measured $W$ by instrumenting the code according to the cost metric \ref{eq:cost}.
For measuring $T$, we used the \texttt{RDTSC} instruction available on all x86 architecture and disabled
Turbo Boost to guarantee an integer runtime. The measurement of $Q$ is the most challenging and requires
performance counters which are not supported by our hardware. A correct, yet too pessimistic lower bound for $Q$
is $Q \geq 8 \cdot S^2$ because we have to load the image once from memory. One of our group members
developed a tool to simulate a program's memory accesses throughout the course, supporting multi-level caches \cite{github-cache}.\\
We simulated our scalar-optimized code with this tool for the hardware we run our benchmarks on, 
which should give us a tighter lower bound for $Q$. 
This simulation is still too pessimistic for the non-optimized code but more accurate for our scalar-optimized and vectorized code. 
Our experiments showed that for small images ($\leq 512 \times 512$), our theoretical bound holds well. 
It is no surprise that for larger images ($\geq 1024 \times 1024$) the theoretical bound is way too pessimistic
because these images do not entirely fit into L3 cache of our hardware anymore, which leads to more traffic between main memory and cache.

To place the baseline in the roofline plot, we calculated the \textit{operational intensity}
$$
I=\frac{W}{Q}
$$
and the \textit{performance}
$$P=\frac{W}{T}$$
of our implementation. Figure \ref{fig:roofline} shows the 
roofline plot for a specific image with different sizes. One can see that the baseline is inherently compute bound and we have good potential for
performance improvement as the baseline runs only at 12.5\% of scalar peak performance. Next, we use 
profiling to find the performance bottlenecks of the code.

\mypar{Hotspots} A major performance blocker is the exhaustive search for block matches.
In our project, we focus solely on performance, 
whereas using a better search strategy as mentioned in section \ref{sec:intro} is an algorithmic improvement
and thus out of scope in the project.

When inspecting the code of the baseline, it is apparent that the majority of the work
is done when calculating the contrast, brightness and error of each range/domain block pair 
(equations \ref{contrast}, \ref{brightness} and \ref{error}). We used \textit{Valgrind} 
\cite{valgrind} to profile the code and the profiling report confirmed our assumption. Especially, the sums
over all pixels of a block were identified as hotspots so we started our optimizations there.

\mypar{Scalar Optimizations} As a first optimization we moved the calculation of the sums $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$, 
$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2$, $\sum_{i=1}^n b_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2$ out of the nested loop 
(see algorithm \ref{alg:baseline} line 5 and 7). The values of these sums change only if the algorithm advances
to the next quadtree depth so we can easily precompute them in each quadtree iteration and reuse them when we
compare each domain block with a range block.

The baseline implementation focuses on a clear and understandable code style. Therefore, it uses a queue 
to keep track of the remaining range blocks and several structs to model different concepts of the algorithm 
(e.g. the image and domain/range blocks). More precisely, a block is a struct with integer coordinates $x,y$ and a size $s$. 
Both the queue and the usage of structs are not optimal for performance so we replaced them 
with simple variables and arrays. With this change, we went from \textit{explicit} to \textit{implicit} blocks. 
A block at quadtree depth $m$ can be uniquely identified by an index $i$. Its size $s$ is depending on $m$, 
and its coordinates $x,y$ can be computed from index $i$. The \textsc{quad} function then reduces to index computations. 
These changes made the code harder to understand but eliminated pointer chasing and placed the 
data better in memory which improves locality.

After the removal of the queue and several structs, we continued to inline several functions, e.g. mapping indices in blocks
to indices in the image. The inlining revealed many small optimizations which were not immediately obvious. 

Another profiling of the optimized version of the code showed that the computation of $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i$, which is used by the equations 
\ref{contrast} and \ref{error}, is the remaining performance bottleneck. Precomputation of this sum is not possible
because the term depends on values from specific range and rotated domain block pixels. The baseline implementation rotated
the domain block by creating 3 copies of it, one for each rotation (90, 180 and 270 degrees). We removed this explicit rotation
to reduce memory reallocation and instead traversing the domain block differently. As an example, when a domain block consists
of pixels $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$, then the access pattern of the 180 degree rotated version of that block is $a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1$.
The fusion of these three implicit rotations into one loop allowed us to compute traversal indices more efficiently.
We furthermore exploited instruction level parallelism (ILP) to calculate the aforementioned computations more efficiently
by factoring out the nested mathematical expressions into single line multiplications, additions and FMAs.
These changes increased not only performance, but also decreased the runtime significantly.
\notejonas{Letzter Satz ins n√§chste Kapitel???}

Finally, we did some experiments with different traversal methods for the domain/range blocks. Like blocked matrix-matrix-multiplication,
we traversed blocks which are closer together in the image to exploit better temporal locality.
With the insights from the roofline analysis, we abandoned any further experiments in that direction, because no big performance
gains can be expected.

\mypar{Vector Optimizations} Different approaches to implement SIMD were
followed. In most successful implementation the computation of brightness,
contrast and error of one range block was performed for four domain blocks at a
time. Sadly only adding SIMD instructions did not lead to a better performance.
The reason for that could be found in the 90 and 270 degree rotations. By simply
removing these two rotations in both the code version with and without SIMD
instructions, a significant increase in performance could be measured in the
version with SIMD.

One major challenge was to avoid expensive gather instructions like
``\_mm256\_i64gather\_pd'' and permutations like ``\_mm256\_permute4x64'' as
much as possible. While it was possible to eliminate the gather operations
completely by smarter precomputations and better memory layout, the permutations
across lanes could not be completely eliminated. As a result, the performance of
the optimized SIMD version was much higher.
